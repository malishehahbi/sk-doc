# Content Style

Write with clarity and restraint. This template favors short, precise language.

## Structure

- Start with a one‑sentence summary.
- Use short sections with `##` headings.
- Keep bullet lists tight and purposeful.

## Tone

- Neutral and confident.
- Avoid filler words.
- Prefer active voice.

## Length

- One idea per section.
- Long pages should be split into multiple docs.

## Examples

Prefer:
- “Set the base path to match your repo.”

Avoid:
- “You might want to consider setting the base path if you feel like it.”

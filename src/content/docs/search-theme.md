# Search & Theme

Search is instant and local. It filters through titles and the full text of every markdown file.

## Behavior

- Typing updates the list immediately.
- Results are ranked by the document order, then title.
- Clear the field to return to the full index.

## In-page search

Each doc page includes a local search that highlights matches in the current document.

## Theme toggle

The toggle writes a `theme` key to `localStorage`, then applies the theme at the document root.

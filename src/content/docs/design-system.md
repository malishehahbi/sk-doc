# Design System

The interface uses a restrained palette and strong layout rhythm. Cards are bordered, typography is quiet, and the grid stays visible.

## Tokens

- Backgrounds are based on warm neutrals for light mode and deep charcoal for dark.
- Accent lines are subtle, thin, and always aligned to the grid.
- Typography favors a strong sans-serif with a geometric edge.

## Layout rules

- Default section spacing is `96px` on desktop and `64px` on mobile.
- Use asymmetric columns to avoid heavy symmetry.
- Let content breathe; avoid stacking more than two dense blocks back-to-back.

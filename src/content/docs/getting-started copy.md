# Getting Started

Welcome to the documentation system. Every page is a markdown file, compiled at build time and rendered with a minimal Swiss layout.

## Quick path

1. Add a markdown file under `src/content/docs`.
2. Use frontmatter to set `title`, `summary`, and `order`.
3. Save and reload — the index and search update automatically.

## Structure

Each doc is stored as plain text. Keep headlines short, write dense paragraphs, and let white space do the talking.

```txt
src/content/docs/
  getting-started.md
  design-system.md
  typography-grid.md
  search-theme.md
```

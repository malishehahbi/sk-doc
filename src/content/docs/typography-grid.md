# Typography & Grid

Set the tone with a restrained scale. Use bold, low-contrast headings and keep body copy compact.

## Type scale

- Display: `48–64px` with tight tracking
- Section titles: `24–32px`
- Body: `16–18px`
- Metadata: `11–12px`, uppercase, high tracking

## Grid

The layout uses a 12‑column grid. Text spans 6–7 columns, while supporting content spans 4–5.

## Markdown rhythm

- Use `#` once for the title.
- Use `##`/`###` for structure so the TOC can index your page.
- Keep paragraphs short to preserve a calm reading rhythm.
